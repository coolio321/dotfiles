# dotfiles
My dotfiles with dwm and dmenu.

Please install libxft-bgra from the AUR before using this dwm or dmenu build.

Added dwm Patches:

fullgaps, centeredmaster, fibonnaci layout, removed the lines that prevented emojis from loading

I haven't modified dmenu at all aside from removing the anti-emoji lines.

A lot of this is just modified stolen dotfiles from reddit, this is more of a personal thing than a public thing since most of these are pretty rough around the edges.
